    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
    <ul>
      <p><b>Information Collection and Use</b><br>
        PassManage does not collect any personal information from users. No registration is required, and no personally
        identifiable information is collected.
        The extension only collects the URLs, usernames, and passwords that users manually enter into the extension.
        The Extension does not collect any personal data from its users.
        When you use the Extension, the only data that is stored is the passwords that you choose to save to the
        Extension's local storage.
        This data is stored locally on your device and is not shared with any third parties.
        </li>
      <p><b>Data Storage and Protection</b><br>
        All the data entered into the PassManage Chrome Extension is stored locally on the user's computer using the
        localStorage API provided by the Chrome browser.
        This means that the data is stored on the user's computer and is not accessible to anyone else.</p>
      <p><b>Sharing of Information</b><br>
        No personal information collected from users is shared, sold, or rented with any third parties.</p>
      <p><b>Third-Party Libraries and Services</b><br>
        The PassManage Chrome Extension uses third-party libraries and services such as Bulma, Google Fonts,
        html2canvas, and pdfmake.
        These libraries and services have their own privacy policies, which are available on their respective websites.
      </p>
      <p><b>Changes to This Privacy Policy</b><br>
        The Privacy Policy may be modified at any time without prior notice.
